This repository contains a [map of transmissions that use ODR](map/).

If you operate a transmitter using the ODR-mmbTools and would like to

The following information is needed:

 * type of transmission: test/regular/planned
 * name of the multiplex
 * DAB channel of the multiplex
 * name of the area covered
 * the date the transmission began or is planned to begin (ideally DD.MM.YYYY)
 * name of the operator
 * URL of the operator
 * additional information URL
 * geographical coordinates in format E.EEEEE, N.NNNNN

Ideally, modify the map data in *map/data.js* and open a pull request.

Thank you!
